                  <h3> <strong>How to Check CDAC C-CAT 2019 Cut Off</strong></h3>
                  <br> <br>
                  <p style="font-size: 17px;">
                  After <strong>CCAT Result</strong> every one starts to find which course, which center I will get as per my rank.
                  Here I am providing roughly best prediction of cut off as per last batch . <strong>CDAC C-CAT Cutoff</strong> will always change each year after each branch but changes are very
                  normal . So whatever guess I provided here is 80% accurate as per this you will get same colleges  .  <br> <br>

                  You can enter course name and your rank greater than value you will get Maximum probability college list that you will get as per your rank.  <br>                   For Ex . your rank is 1200 then you can select Your Rank > 1000
              
                  Rank range on website is in 500 range - Ex . 500,1000,1500 etc. <br>
                    <br>
                  <strong>How to check for my rank 600 ?</strong> <br>
                  <br>
                  Here read carefully if lets say my rank is 600 and i want to check cutoff for dac course with my rank so i will select DAC 
                  then i will select your rank > option 500 and do a search then you will get all the college list as per your rank. <br><br>

                  Please consider 200,300 rank difference in real means if website says for you rank lets say 1200  you will not get sunbeam pune but sometimes it may be 
                  possible you can get sunbeam pune for 1200 rank also . So just keep 200,300 rank difference for better result . <br>
